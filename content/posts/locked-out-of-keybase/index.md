## Keybase
I locked myself out of Keybase 🦝
If you get a message from [juniperspring](https://keybase.io/juniperspring) on Keybase, don't trust it.
See my GitHub gist for more info: [https://gist.github.com/librick/8070876676dc02c83fea756fb78dd768](https://gist.github.com/librick/8070876676dc02c83fea756fb78dd768).

I lost access to my Keybase account.
I was playing around with the CLI and ran the following commands:  
```
keybase account lockdown
keybase logout
```

Apparently those are bad commands to run when you've revoked all other devices and forgot your Keybase password. I still have keys for one of my devices, but AFAIK they're encrypted with some secret derived from my Keybase password.

juniperspring is digitally stateless now 😔⛵
unmoored and untethered from Keybase, my account lives on in Merkle forest hashes,
floating among memos on the Stellar chain

>Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,  
Missing me one place search another,  
I stop somewhere waiting for you.
