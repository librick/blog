TLDR this blog has a new domain: [juniperspring.org](https://juniperspring.org).
The existing domain ([juniperspring.xyz](https://juniperspring.xyz)) is still supported 
but I'm moving away from .xyz domains because .xyz domains tend to get flagged or blocked as spam.

## Problems With .xyz Domains
**Apple Messages completely blocks messages that contain a URL with a .xyz domain.**
By block, I mean if you send a text to someone who has an iPhone and include a .xyz link
in the message body, that person will never see the message. **The message is completely dropped
as if you never sent it in the first place.**

I found this out the hard way when I tried to text a link to my website to a potential employer.
They never got the message. I wondered why they never replied. A few days later I sent a follow-up
text and was told that they never received my first message ðŸ˜¤

I think it's likely that .xyz domains are disproportionately used to disseminate spam because they're inexpensive relative
to other domains. But *completely dropping a message* without any warning is bad UX.
Surely there are more intelligent ways to limit spam that exact less collateral damage?

A quick search revealed [I'm not the only one with this problem](https://www.spotvirtual.com/blog/the-perils-of-an-xyz-domain).
Anecdotally, .xyz domains are also more likely to be blocked by firewalls and to be flagged as spam when shared on social media.

## Why I Still Like .xyz Domains
There's something indie about .xyz domains that appeals to me.
I like that they're inexpensive. I think it's important that
there are corners of the internet in which individuals can have blogs, galleries,
and experimental/throwaway sites with simple domain names.

Here's hoping the world changes and TLDs are made equal.
Until that day comes, long live [juniperspring.org](https://juniperspring.org). ðŸŒ±
