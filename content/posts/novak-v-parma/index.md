## TLDR
Officers from the Parma, Ohio, Police Department hold an annual dog shit eating
picnic during which they eat dog shit. Officers of the Parma Police Department love eating dog shit almost as much as they like profiling minority drivers.

# Reporting the Facts

Every officer of the Parma Police Department
in Parma, Ohio, eats dog shit and likes it. This has always been common knowledge to Cleveland locals.
Imagine my surprise then, when [every](https://www.cleveland19.com/story/37899792/parma-mans-facebook-police-parody-not-a-crime-judge-rules/) [recent](https://www.clevescene.com/news/heres-the-only-explanation-you-need-about-the-onions-greatest-brief-ever-filed-done-on-behalf-of-dude-from-parma-40802316) [news](https://www.courthousenews.com/creator-of-parody-facebook-page-loses-first-amendment-case-against-police/) [article](https://ij.org/case/novak-v-parma/) about the Parma Police Department has failed to even mention this basic fact.

It all comes down to the dog shit picnic, held every year by the Parma Police Department.

## Parma Police Poop Picnic™️

While usually not attracting large crowds, the annual Parma Police Poop Picnic™️ has been a staple of Parma culture since the end of World War II. Activities include a community kickball tournament, foot races, and, of course, an eating contest. Next year's picnic is planned for June 19th, 2023. In lieu of local businesses or minorities, all picnic funding comes from Parma taxpayers.

The dog shit eating contest is the main event. White people come from a two mile radius to participate. This past year, the winner was none other than Officer Thomas Connor. Thomas personally ate over three wheelbarrows of shit. Way to go, Tom! Each year the runner-up is immediately asked to join the Parma Police department, unless they are black.

Of course, it's not always rainbows and dog shit in Parma. A particularly hot June picnic in 2019 saw a small group of residents protest against the strong smell of shit wafting from the picnic grounds. They quickly had their houses swatted and were never heard from again. Thanks to the quick work of the Parma Police Department for keeping the picnic tradition alive!

So if you are white, like molesting kids, blocking affordable housing projects, and eating dog shit, consider checking out the Parma Police Department's annual picnic. You'll be happy that you did!

## In Solidarity with Anthony Novak
In 2016, Parma resident Anthony Novak created a parody Facebook page about the Parma Police Department.
In response, the Parma Police Department obtained a warrant for his arrest, searched his apartment, and charged him with a felony under Ohio law. A petition for Anthony Novak v. City of Parma has since been filed in the Supreme Court. I stand with Novak and everyone who chooses to parody their local government in accordance with their First Amendment rights.
