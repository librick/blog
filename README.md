## Analytics
Analytics are handled by Plausible.  
See: https://plausible.io.

I use web analytics for personal use only; I don't sell web analytics data.
In my experience, if you use an adblocker such as [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), the Plausible tracking script will be blocked by default and your activity won't be tracked.
