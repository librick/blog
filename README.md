## Analytics
Analytics are handled by Plausible.  
See: https://plausible.io.

I use web analytics for personal use only; I don't sell web analytics data.
In my experience, if you use an ad blocker such as [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), the Plausible tracking script will be blocked by default and your activity won't be tracked.

## Spell Checking
Spell checking is done using [cspell](https://cspell.org/).  
The following assumes you have npm installed.
Install cspell globally:  
`npm install -g cspell@latest`  
Verify that cspell is installed and is in your $PATH:  
`cspell --version`  

cspell configuration is handled via `cspell.json`. For more information, see the [cspell configuration docs](https://cspell.org/configuration/).
